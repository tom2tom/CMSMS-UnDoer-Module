CMS Made Simple module which enables recording and reverting changes to recorded content, templates, stylesheets.

A tarball containing the content of this repo, plus translated interface-strings, is available from [DropBox](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/zww60ytol09e2qkgfj6mp/UnDoer.tar.bz2?rlkey=3rroronwjgqcmz22vsybbru1r&st=vo4erxxa&dl=0).

**NOTE** for this module to work properly, it is necessary to work around some 'unfortunate' aspects of the recent official CMSMS releases.

The necessary minor tweaks are included in the [2.2.21F2 unofficial fork](https://github.com/tom2tom/CMSMS22XDev/tree/2221F2).
